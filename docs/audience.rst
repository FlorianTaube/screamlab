Target audience
===============

Who is the target audience of the screamlab package? Is it interesting for me?

People who are interested in performing SCREAM-DNP experiments
==============================================================

The package is intended for NMR spectroscopists who have the equipment to perform dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR and are interested in conducting SCREAM-DNP experiments (specific cross-relaxation enhancement by active motions). It was developed to automate the extraction of kinetic information from spectra in various ways and to simplify the evaluation process as much as possible. Additionally, a major focus is placed on data reproducibility, as this is of general importance to science.

Motivation
==========
The motivation behind this package is to provide a reproducible and user-friendly approach for evaluating SCREAM-DNP data, ensuring consistency in analysis and visualization. Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, and this package facilitates it by structuring data evaluation in a transparent and standardized manner.
Test
By leveraging well-documented workflows and structured processing, the package aims to make SCREAM-DNP data analysis accessible while maintaining rigor. Those who prioritize reproducibility in their research will find this package a valuable tool for ensuring traceable and reliable results.
