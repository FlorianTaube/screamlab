Roadmap

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.2.0
=================

* Expanding the spectral decomposition to more complicated lineshapes, including CSA or NQI.
* Allowing SCREAM-DNP buildup fitting to be performed under the assumption of Solomon equations.
* Expanding the area of application to other kinetic experiments, such as saturation recovery or REDOR.
