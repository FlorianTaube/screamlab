Who are the people behind the screamlab package?

The so far only developer is Florian Taube. The package was devoloped during the time as doctoral student in the working group of Björn Corzilius at Rostock University.

Special thanks to Mirjam Schröder and Till Biskup for their endless support with every technical challenge, their time for discussions, and their help by improving my programming.
